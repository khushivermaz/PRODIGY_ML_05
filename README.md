"Thrilled to unveil Task-05: Developing a Model to Recognize Food Items from Images and Estimate Their Calorie Content! üçΩÔ∏èüìâ - brought to you by Prodigy InfoTech
In this innovative project, I created a model capable of not only identifying food items from images but also estimating their calorie content. This model is designed to empower users to monitor their dietary intake with precision and make healthier food choices.
Utilizing the extensive dataset from Kaggle's Food-101, I employed advanced image recognition techniques and calorie estimation algorithms to deliver a robust and user-friendly solution.
Dive into the project on my GitHub to explore the methodology, code, and outcomes. This project is a step forward in combining computer vision with practical health applications.
